# Table of key results

 Table: Validation and width results across different sample sizes and dimensions for four different experiments. Highlighted are
the narrowest bounds that have a validity greater than 0.5. These experiments are averaged over 500 Monte Carlo iterations.


This table demonstrates that as dimensionality increases the bounds become unreliable. The only bounds that capture the BER in high dimensions are too wide to provide meaninfully provide where the BER is.
